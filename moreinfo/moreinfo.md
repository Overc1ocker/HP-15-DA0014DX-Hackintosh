**More info about this laptop**

- The preinstalled SSD is a Sandisk 128GB SSD. It is **SATA** based even though it plugs into the M.2 slot! This specific SSD will not be detected in Big Sur. Use CtlnaAHCIPort kext to fix! You may also replace this with a NVME based SSD.
- The brightness keys do not work natively. A PS2 remap has been included in the SSDT-HPbrightkeys-trackpadbtns SSDT. This maps F2 and F3 to the brightness keys.
- The Trackpad buttons **DO NOT** work without a VoodooPS2 specific SSDT! This has been included.
- The WIFI card is not original. The included Realtek card **DOES NOT** work in macOS. Plus it is lacking newer WiFi technlogies. I'd recommend replacing it with a Intel or Broadcom supported wifi card (or use ethernet). For Intel wifi cards, a special *itlwm* kext is required!

- Sleep occasionally breaks. I will include the fix when I get a chance to upload.
- Cpu runs inefficiently. I used CPU friend to fix. Will include this later. LFM for this CPU is 400mhz
- Builtin HDMI port does not work properly without a config.plist mode change for con1 to hdmi. I will include the fix later.

**If you love living on the edge, the CFG LOCK on this system may be removed."**  
Make sure you fully understand what you are doing before you try. DO NOT TRUST RANDOM PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET.  
Hint: The "setup" EFI variable is locked, however the "CPUsetup" variable is not. Use RU.exe to edit  
Set 0x3C to 0x0 to disable CFGlock   
I'm not responsible for bricked computers  
After, remove CFG-Lock quirks from opencore  

**If you have removed CFG lock, why not set DVMT-PreAlloc to 64mb**  
This will bring your IGPU to FULL POWER!  
This setting exists in the "SAsetup" EFI var (unlocked)  
Set 0xDF to 0x2 for the required 64MB of memory   
After this, remove the stolenmem patches
